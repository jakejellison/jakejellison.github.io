		<h1>Murray's Bagel</h1>
		<h2>Sweetgreen</h2>
		<h3>Sergimmo Salumeria West Village</h3>
		<h4>O Cafe</h4>
		<h5>Pasta Flyer</h5>
		<p>I really like <a href="pastaflyer.com">Pasta Flyer</a> because it's never crowded and the food is always made fresh. There's plenty of room to sit, and there are a lot of options on the menu. It's good for sitting down to eat, or taking food to go between classes. They also offer a student discount, so it's relatively affordable. It's one of the few places where you can get cooked pasta and it's not over $15 - last week I went somewhere two blocks down the street and paid $25! They offer a lot of different customizable menu options to cater to every taste.
