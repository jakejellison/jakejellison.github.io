		<h1>Supreme Pizza Dippers Recipie</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>I have chosen to represent this dish because it is unbelievably delicious. When I was a kid I used to watch re-runs of The Chew on ABC and when I saw them make these on TV, it really inspred me to try it out for myself, and was probably one of the first times I took a recipie off the internet and made it for myself. Nostalga aside, they make a really great snack. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 Pound of Hot Italian Sausage</li>
			<li>1/2 Pound of Pepperoni</li>
			<li>Kosher Salt</li>
			<li>Black Pepper</li>
			<li>2 Lbs. of Pizza Dough</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place a 10 inch cast iron pan in an oven and preheat oven to 425°F.</li>
			<li>In a small bowl, stir together 1/2 cup of the parmesan cheese with the oregano, parsley and season with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>In a medium sauté pan heat a few tablespoons of olive oil over medium. Add the sausage and cook until crispy, breaking up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool.</li>
			<li>Add the bell peppers to the pan and sauté for 2 minutes just to soften. Use a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate.</li>
			<li>In the same pan with the sausage drippings remaining, add the meatballs and cook on all sides until dark golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool.</li>
			<li>Toss the filling ingredients plus shredded mozzarella together to combine.</li>
			<li>On a lightly floured surface, with a floured rolling pin, roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness. Use a floured 3 inch biscuit cutter to cut circles out of the dough.</li>
			<li>Place a small amount of filling into the center of each circle.</li>
			<li>Once all the dough circles are topped with filling begin to pinch the edges of each circle together to form filled balls of dough.</li>
			<li>Remove the hot pan from the oven and drizzle with a few tablespoons of olive oil. Place the balls seam side down into the pan. Brush the top with olive oil and sprinkle with the cheese mixture.</li>
			<li>Bake for 15 minutes or until deep golden brown on top.</li>
			<li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
			<li>Garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese, anchovies and warm marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
