		<div id="intro">
		I have chosen to represent this dish because it is unbelievably delicious. When I was a kid I used to watch re-runs of The Chew on ABC and when I saw them make these on TV, it really inspred me to try it out for myself, and was probably one of the first times I took a recipie off the internet and made it for myself. Nostalga aside, they make a really great snack.
