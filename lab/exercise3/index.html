		<div class="description"><p>I know strawberries are out of season now, but this lime strawberry champagne fits perfectly for New Year celebrations. These beautiful glasses have to be in your hands when starting the new year with your beloved ones. We use frozen strawberries for this recipe when we make it during winter, so you can do the same. On the other hand, if you are a citrus lover, go check our Orange Vodka Martini recipe!</p>

		<p>We love to prepare fruit cocktails and serve them in some fancy glasses. I come up with a different cocktail recipe whenever I see, smell and taste strawberries. One of our favorites is Fresh Strawberry Margarita, which is another perfect match for celebrations. We wanted to make something sparkly this time and ended up with this amazing strawberry champagne drink recipe. Besides strawberry and champagne, the third ingredient really helps this cocktail become even more refreshing. Yes, Iâ€™m talking about lime. Oh my! I adore its unique scent!</p>
